# Survey data cleaning

Here you can see a preview of my assignment. I decided to combine the eyecolor and the favorite wind direction of the student.

## üí° Concept
My concept was to fetch data from a survey filled in by students. After fetching the data i cleaned the data. Then i decided to display the eyecolor and favorite wind direction of the students.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Clone the repo to your own device
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jody29/functional-programming.git
```

When using visual studio code, install the Live Server extension

<br/>
Right clik on the index.html file and select
<br/>
![livepreview](assets/img/livepreview.png)
This way you can open the file in your browser


## :inbox_tray: Data
Documentation of how i cleaned the data can be found on the [wiki]()

## :pray: Wishlist
* npm package to convert the color names to hexcode
* npm package to convert the wind directions to emojis
